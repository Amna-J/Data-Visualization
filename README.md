Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview
This Colaboratory notebook serves as a foundational project for learning core data analysis and visualization techniques in Python. The objective is to load a common benchmark dataset (Iris), inspect its structure and descriptive statistics, and generate various plots to understand data distributions, feature relationships, and identify potential outliers.

Skills Demonstrated:

Data loading and manipulation using pandas.

Data inspection and descriptive statistics.

Univariate and bivariate visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the famous Iris Flower Dataset. It contains 150 instances of Iris flowers, each described by four features and classified into one of three species.

Dataset Features:

sepal_length: Length of the sepal in cm.

sepal_width: Width of the sepal in cm.

petal_length: Length of the petal in cm.

petal_width: Width of the petal in cm.

species: The target class (Iris Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).

Dependencies
The notebook requires the following standard Python data science libraries:

pandas: For data loading and manipulation.

numpy: For numerical operations.

seaborn: For high-level statistical data visualization.

matplotlib.pyplot: For plot customization and rendering.

Analysis and Visualization Steps
The notebook follows a structured EDA workflow:

1. Data Loading and Inspection
The initial steps focus on understanding the shape and integrity of the loaded data:

Data Loading: The iris.csv file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. (Note: The current notebook reads the CSV from a Google Drive path: /content/drive/MyDrive/Data Visualization/iris.csv).

Quick View: Displaying the first and last five rows (.head() and .tail()).

Structure Check: Using .info() to check data types and non-null counts. (Result: All 150 entries are non-null, confirming no missing data).

Summary Statistics: Using .describe() to view central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the numerical features.

Missing Values: Confirming zero missing values across all columns (.isnull().sum()).

2. Univariate Visualization (Distributions)
We use histograms to visualize the distribution of individual features.

species Histogram: A histogram of the species column confirms the dataset is perfectly balanced, with 50 instances for each of the three species.

All Features Histograms: Generating a set of histograms for all numerical columns (sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width). This helps reveal the underlying shape of the data, such as the bimodal nature of petal_length and petal_width, indicating clear separation between the species.

3. Scatter Plot (Feature Relationships)
A scatter plot is used to identify the correlation between two key features.

Plot: sepal_length vs. petal_length.

Insight: The plot clearly shows a strong positive linear correlation between sepal length and petal length. In a colored version (like those generated by seaborn.pairplot), distinct clusters representing the different Iris species would be visible.

4. Box Plot (Outliers and Group Comparison)
Box plots are essential for visualizing the distribution, spread, and identifying outliers per category.

Plot: species vs. sepal_length.

Insight: This plot demonstrates the differences in sepal length across the three species. The box plot visually represents the quartiles and median, and any points extending far beyond the whiskers are potential outliers.

5. Bar Plot (Mean Comparison)
A bar plot is used to visually compare the mean value of a numerical feature across categorical groups.

Plot: species vs. sepal_length.

Insight: The bar plot confirms that, on average, Iris species 3 (Virginica) has the largest sepal length, followed by species 2 (Versicolor), and species 1 (Setosa) has the smallest.
